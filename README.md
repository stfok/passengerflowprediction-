Metro Passenger Flow Prediction with S-DGNN
Project Overview
This project implements the Sequence Directed Graph Neural Network (S-DGNN) model for predicting passenger flow at metro transfer stations, based on the research paper:

Prediction and Warning Method for Large Passenger Flow in Metro Transfer Stations Based on Spatial and Temporal Characteristics of Personnel Trajectories

The model leverages spatial-temporal characteristics of passenger trajectories to predict transfer station flows with over 90% accuracy, enabling early warning systems for large passenger flow risks.

Key Features
 Transfer-Centric Topology: Novel graph structure focusing on transfer stations

 Time Delay Modeling: Accounts for travel time between stations

 S-DGNN Architecture: Combines Directed Graph Neural Networks with Gated Recurrent Units

 High Accuracy: Achieves >90% prediction accuracy on transfer station flows

 Scenario-Specific Models: Separate training for weekday and weekend patterns

 Real-time Capable: Inference in 0.12 seconds per prediction



The S-DGNN model consists of two main components:

Spatial Module (DGNN):

Processes metro network as directed graph

Incorporates time delay calculations

Uses transfer-centric topology

Edge attributes: correlation weights, distances, departure intervals

Temporal Module (GRU):

Captures time series dependencies

Processes sequential passenger flow data

100 hidden units for optimal performance

Key Implementation Details
Metro Topology
84 general stations + 4 transfer stations

4 metro lines with interconnections:

Line 1  Line 2 at T1

Line 2  Line 3 at T2

Line 3  Line 4 at T3

Line 4  Line 1 at T4

Graph Structure
python
# Transfer-centric topology connections
adj[general_i][transfer_j] = 1.0  # If same line
adj[transfer_i][transfer_j] = 1.0 # If same line (bidirectional)
Time Delay Calculation
python
time_delay = distances / (metro_speed / 60) + departure_interval / 2
Model Input/Output
Input: Sequence of station entry flows (4 × 15-min intervals)

Output: Predicted passenger flow at 4 transfer stations (next 15-min)
